# Armadillo pooling detector
The intention of this script is to check if there are forks in armadillo mainchain, given that a single fork is common in network, becasuse miners can be stuck mining a wrong height (past or future height)
Fork should have more than 3 elements in each array, this means that a fork is growing with the time.

## Set up
**``npm install``**

## Run
``npm run-script start``
